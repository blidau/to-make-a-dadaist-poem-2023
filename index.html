      <li>Choose an article as long as you are planning to make your poem.</li>
      <li>Cut out the article.</li>

        Then cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them in
        a bag.

      <li>Shake it gently.</li>
      <li>
        Then take out the scraps one after the other in the order in which they
        left the bag.

      <li>Copy conscientiously.</li>
      <li>The poem will be like you.</li>

        vulgar.

      The massive ramp-up of Centrelink’s debt-raising activities resulted in significant public controversy in late 2016 and early 2017, prompting Turnbull to voice some concerns with the then human services minister, Alan Tudge.

On Monday, the commission was shown WhatsApp messages between Turnbull and Tudge, as well as the then social services minister, Christian Porter.

On 7 January 2017, Turnbull sent Tudge a link to a Sydney Morning Herald article by Peter Martin that was highly critical of the scheme and said the way it calculated debts could be unlawful.

In the WhatsApp exchange, Tudge replied by saying “it is not correct that we simply take the average of the income declared to ATO and apply that average across 26 fortnights”.

Despite Tudge’s explanation, the commissioner, Catherine Holmes, told the inquiry on Monday that was how the scheme often worked.

Asked if it became apparent that’s what was happening, Turnbull said he didn’t “recall that”.

More broadly, Turnbull said he had accepted what Tudge had told him about the program, as the “responsible minister”.

Asked if he believed Tudge had a good grasp on how the system worked, Turnbull said he regarded the minister “as a technocrat”, noting he was a former consultant.
